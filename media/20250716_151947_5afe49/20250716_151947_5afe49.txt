If you're looking for a Japanese dining spot in Newcastle that nails the vibe and the flavors, then this is your sign to check out Nagisa. It is right on the harbor at Honeysuckle with both indoor and outdoor seating and yep, the food is as good as it looks. We started with the spicy chili edamame, which was so addictive but in the best way possible. Then we had the kingfish carpaccio, which is always an absolute favorite of mine. The beef wagyu tataki, which was tender and buttery, and the prawn and shallot gyozas were soaking in the most amazing miso broth and they were gone in seconds. Then came the mains. We had their two brand new We had two dishes which were the pork belly and the duck breast and they were both cooked to absolute perfection. But we had to leave room for dessert of course because they had bonafi gyoza. Yes, that is a thing and it is as incredible as it sounds. And then we finished off with some yuzu sorbet which is the most refreshing way to end the night. So if you're a fan of modern Japanese with killer cocktails then add Nagisa to your must visit list.
