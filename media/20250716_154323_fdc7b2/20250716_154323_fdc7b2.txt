If you're a pastry lover like me, then Lode Pies has just opened two new stores in Sydney and I may have blacked out when ordering half of the menu, but I had zero regrets. First up we tried the Wagyu and mushroom pie, which was so rich and buttery and the filling was next level. I would give this one a solid eight out of ten. Then I tried the chicken teriyaki sausage roll. This one caught me off guard in the best way possible. It was slightly sweet but super savory, a nine out of ten. Next up was the pistachio croissant. This was flaky, nutty, but not too sweet. So if you're a pistachio lover, you will love this one. I gave it a seven out of ten. Croissant was basically dessert disguised as breakfast. It was banana, pecan, and chocolate, a seven out of ten. The raspberry tart was super vibrant and fresh. And if you like fruity desserts, then this is a must-try, and I gave it a nine and a half out of ten. Next up we had the yuzu tart. This one was tangy, zesty, and super creamy. I'd give this one an eight and a half out of ten. It is perfect if you love citrus. And finally, the cinnamon guy, the ultimate cinnamon scroll, an easy nine out of ten. So make sure you check out Load Pies now in Surrey Hills, Circular Quay, and North Sydney. Grab yourself a selection of their baked goods and flaky pastries and thank me later
