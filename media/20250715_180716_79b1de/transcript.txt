Why keep name as perplexity? It's so difficult to say. I was talking to so many people in the organization because I use perplexity and there are two three people who use perplexity and then when we spoke to everyone that hey, you know what, we're gonna get the founder, we'll do this and they're like, it's such a difficult name, we'll never gonna be able to even download it and use it. And it's a it's an important question. You know, when I started, I didn't really have a clear sense of like, you know, whether we'll build a search app or a consumer application. None of that. Like we were, we knew we wanted to do something in search. We knew like we wanted to build like unique experiences that were not possible before. We were not dreaming big like, oh, we're going to build a billion user product potentially. So, um, when you pick a name for the company, you pick something pretty cool, like and easy to get a domain for. You know, I I didn't have much money at the beginning of funding.
